\chapter{Introduction}

Humans reason about the surrounding world by decomposing it into orthogonal components.
The idea of an object is decoupled from the qualities of the object: it is very
easy for us to imagine a pink elephant, even though we have never observed such
an animal, and these two words suffice for us to imagine a visual scene.
The words are a latent representation of the scene.

Variational Autoencoders (VAE) \cite{bib:vae_paper} are a powerful framework for
learning latent representations. Much work has already been done on disentangled
representations, where we require that any two latent variables are uncorrelated.

Our work focuses on model-based disentanglement of objects. In particular, we
would like to have one individual VAE which is trained to recognise and
represent a single type of object: in a normal setting, we could have one VAE
which represents chairs, another VAE which represents tables, and so on.
We will call our approach the \textbf{SuperVAE}.

Most similar in spirit is the \cite{bib:monet}, where a single VAE model
iteratively recognises objects from a scene by using attention masks.
The main difference is that the MONet uses a single VAE for all objects, whereas
we use multiple VAE's in parallel.
Another similar idea is contained in \cite{bib:iodine}, where they have a single
VAE which tries to model the scene, and where they iteratively refine the latent
parameters.

\section{Method}

\subsection{SuperVAE}


The SuperVAE network tries to reconstructor a scene by feeding the image to some
VAE's connected in parallel, whereby every VAE models a separate part of the scene.


Let us say that there are $K$ VAE's, where each of them tries to model a
different object.
Then the image $X$ will be fed independently to
each of them.

Each VAE will then model a distribution over the latent variables,
$q_{theta_k}(\textbf{z}_k | \textbf{X})$.

By sampling from these distribution, they will generate two outputs of
the same size as the image: $\^{X}_{k}$, which is the $k$'th model
reconstruction of the image, and $\^{m}_{k}$, which is a confidence mask.

This confidence mask represents how sure a VAE is about its output for a given
pixel. Higher confidence means that the pixel is part of an object which is of
the type the VAE is modelling.

These confidence masks are produced by first having the models generate some
``raw'' confidence values, and then taking a pixel-wise softmax across all of
the $k$ models.

Thus, the masks are a probability distribution, where for each pixel we have
what is the probability that it belongs to an object modelled by a VAE:

$\sum_{i = 1}^{k} \^{m}_{k} = \textbf{1}$.

Our loss function is

\[
  \mathcal{L(\theta_1, ..., \theta_k)} =
  \sum_{i = 1}^{k} (\^{X}_{i} - X)^2 \cdot \^{m}_{i}
  +
  \beta \sum_{i = 1}^{k}
\]

This is version \verb-v1.4- of the template.

We assume that you found this template on our institute's website, so
we do not repeat everything stated there.  Consult the website again
for pointers to further reading about \LaTeX{}.  This chapter only
gives a brief overview of the files you are looking at.

\section{Features}
\label{sec:features}

The rest of this document shows off a few features of the template
files.  Look at the source code to see which macros we used!

The template is divided into \TeX{} files as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \texttt{thesis.tex} is the main file.
\item \texttt{extrapackages.tex} holds extra package includes.
\item \texttt{layoutsetup.tex} defines the style used in this document.
\item \texttt{theoremsetup.tex} declares the theorem-like environments.
\item \texttt{macrosetup.tex} defines extra macros that you may find
  useful.
\item \texttt{introduction.tex} contains this text.
\item \texttt{sections.tex} is a quick demo of each sectioning level
  available.
\item \texttt{refs.bib} is an example bibliography file.  You can use
  Bib\TeX{} to quote references.  For example, read
  \cite{bringhurst1996ets} if you can get a hold of it.
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Extra package includes}

The file \texttt{extrapackages.tex} lists some packages that usually
come in handy.  Simply have a look at the source code.  We have
added the following comments based on our experiences:
\begin{description}
\item[REC] This package is recommended.
\item[OPT] This package is optional.  It usually solves a specific
  problem in a clever way.
\item[ADV] This package is for the advanced user, but solves a problem
  frequent enough that we mention it. Consult the package's
  documentation.
\end{description}

As a small example, here is a reference to the Section \emph{Features}
typeset with the recommended \package{varioref} package:
\begin{quote}
  See Section~\vref{sec:features}.
\end{quote}


\subsection{Layout setup}

This defines the overall look of the document -- for example, it
changes the chapter and section heading appearance.  We consider this
a `do not touch' area.  Take a look at the excellent \emph{Memoir}
documentation before changing it.

In fact, take a look at the excellent \emph{Memoir} documentation,
full stop.


\subsection{Theorem setup}

This file defines a bunch of theorem-like environments.

\begin{theorem}
  An example theorem.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  Proof text goes here.
\end{proof}

Note that the q.e.d.\ symbol moves to the correct place automatically
if you end the proof with an \texttt{enumerate} or
\texttt{displaymath}.  You do not need to use \verb-\qedhere- as with
\package{amsthm}.

\begin{theorem}[Some Famous Guy]
  Another example theorem.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  This proof
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item ends in an enumerate.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}
  Note that all theorem-like environments are by default numbered on
  the same counter.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
  This proof ends in a display like so:
  \begin{displaymath}
    f(x) = x^2.
  \end{displaymath}
\end{proof}


\subsection{Macro setup}

For now the macro setup only shows how to define some basic macros,
and how to use a neat feature of the \package{mathtools} package:
\begin{displaymath}
  \abs{a}, \quad \abs*{\frac{a}{b}}, \quad \abs[\big]{\frac{a}{b}}.
\end{displaymath}
