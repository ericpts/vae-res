# VAE Project

Test out if it is possible to make VAE's each learn to recognize a different
object.

For example, let us consider the MNIST dataset restricted only to the digits 0
and 1.
We would like to have 2 VAE's, and have each one of them learn to represent the
digit 0, and the other one learn to represent the digit 1.
