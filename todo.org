`tf.function-decorated function tried to create variables on non-first call.`

** TODO Implement entropy loss.
*** Do a pixel-wise entropy function (i.e., for each pixel consider that the VAE's give a probability distribution, and compute the entropy for each pixel).
*** Then take the sum of all entropies, and add Alpha * log(S) to the loss function, where Alpha is a hyperparameter.
*** Keep in mind that maybe we have to normalize the Entropy term depending on the number of VAE's.
** TODO Implement VAE's for 3 digits.
** TODO Figure out what is the best way to freeze a VAE
*** One way would be to make the learning rate very small, so that nothing changes.
